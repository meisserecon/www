		<p>Meisser Economics is a research boutique founded by Luzius Meisser, computer scientist and economist. We want to leverage principles of modern software engineering to build bigger, better, and more versatile economic models. While traditional mathematical models tend to be monolithic and suffer from the curse of dimensionality, properly designed algorithmic models scale much better with increasing complexity. Their building blocks are stateful, encapsulated agents that interact with each other through open markets. Ideally, the basic equilibria they find match classic results, providing confidence for exploring configurations that are not as easily accessible with traditional methods and advancing the frontiers of economic knowledge.</p>
