<b>About</b>

<p><a href="https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/index.html#/modules/list/2017/003/50773378-50772427/details/SM/50857786">Agent-based financial economics</a> is an interdisciplinary master-level course for economists and computer scientists offered by the department of Banking & Finance of University of Zurich. It is worth 3.0 ECTS credits and counts as BF4, ECON2, or more generally as OEC/WWF course for University of Zurich students, and as elective course for computer scientists from ETH.</p>

<p>Agent-based financial economics is a controversial but also promising modeling methodology that thrives best when combining economics knowledge with sound software engineering. The course starts with an introduction to the principles of agent-based modeling, including its strength and weaknesses. Then, step by step, we create a large-scale economic simulation by introducing new and increasingly sophisticated agents (households, firms, funds, etc.), comparing the simulated outcomes with the equilibria known from classic economic theory. These agents are implemented by interdisciplinary teams of two students each, one from economics or finance and one from computer science. The fitness of these economic agents is tested in a competitive setting. Due to the complexity of the simulation, agents will likely have to resort to behavioral heuristics. The interesting question is: will the invisible hand succeed in guiding them towards the efficient outcome anyway?</p>

<b>Teaser</b>

<p><img src="/assets/images/tradeview.png" alt="" class="image full"> Your agents will compete in an economic simulation that is updated in real-time as your submit new versions of your agents. You can run the simulation on your computer locally, but also view it online to see how your agents interact with the others.</p>

<b>Recurring Themes</b>

<p>Emergence: how do the micro-properties of a system shape its macro-characteristics? When is the whole more than the sum of its parts?

Evolutionary finance: what strategies do survive in the long run and how do evolutionary dynamics impact the macro outcome?

Heuristics: Are there simple heuristics based on local information that allow agents to perform similarly well as agents with rational expectations and perfect information?</p>

<b>Literature</b>

<p>Farmer and Foley published a nice <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duncan_Foley/publication/51437577_The_Economy_Needs_Agent-Based_Modeling/links/5714ccb108aeebe07c06c72e/The-Economy-Needs-Agent-Based-Modeling.pdf">motivational article</a> on why we need agent-based modeling in the well-known journal Nature. A list with some classics from the literature on agent-based economics can be found on <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/afinance.htm#BasicRead">Leigh Testfatsion's site</a>. Another early and notable economic model is <a href="http://www.ifn.se/storage/cms/91fc7b2ed0f3440a918871ffa0a36d73/59024245407a4a3fadebca71db86015e/pdf/B79AF4E97E52C2C7723DD26462792BE1AB13FF08/Wp222.pdf?MediaArchive_ForceDownload=true&PropertyName=File1&ValueIndex=0">MOSES by Gunnar Eliassion</a>, which served as a basis for various Swedisch economic policy decisions. The biggest effort so far to build a large-scale agent-based economic models is the European <a href="http://www.crisis-economics.eu/">Crisis Economics project</a>. However, most of these later models focus on economics alone and do not feature a stock market. More literature will be provided during the course as needed. Generally, we will stick closer to classic general equilibrium models than other contemporary agent-based models, similar to like I previously did in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-016-9616-x">this publication</a>.</p>

<b>Grading</b>

<p>There is no exam. Grades are based on exercises as well as a short presentation in the end. In the exercises, you are graded as a team, whereas the presentation is graded individually. Computer scientists present the economic aspects of their findings, whereas economists will present the software engineering view.</p>

<b>Registration</b>

<p>If you want to attend this course, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiUZGNaYk8NIR_RWXHa7f5W4S-vUUTmfpFBs0hOOgmZ22x-w/viewform?usp=sf_link">fill in this form</a> before September 21st. Seats are assigned on a first-come-first-serve basis and limited to 30 students. Do not forget to also register in the <a href="https://idagreen.uzh.ch/mb/">UZH module booking system</a> before October 13th, whereas ETH students first need to <a href="http://www.uzh.ch/de/studies/application/mobilitaet/applyhsuma.html">register here</a> before September 15th, choosing "Wirtschaftswissenschaftl. Fakult√§t" and "MA UZH Wirtschaftswissenschaften". Grades will then automatically be transferred to the ETH booking system once the semester is over.</p>

<p>Teams of two will be formed during the first lecture on September 22nd.</p>
