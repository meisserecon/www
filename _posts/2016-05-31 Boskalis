title: Applied Game Theory or How to Pay a Dividend without Paying a Dividend
---
<a href="boskalis.com">Koninklijke Boskalis Westminster</a> lets its shareholders choose whether they want to receive their yearly
dividend in cash or in the form of newly created shares. When opting for cash, the Dutch take a tax of 15% regardless of where you live.
If you opt for the shares, you get the full amount tax-free.

This creates an interesting situation: it makes sense for each individual sharesholder to opt for the shares, thereby saving the taxes
and getting strictly more value than when opting for cash. However, if every shareholder does so, Boskalis does not need to distribute
a single cent. Instead, it can just issue a few new shares to its shareholders, which makes the whole operation
a de facto stock split instead of a dividend payment. Nothing of value leaves the company and the intrinsic value of the company stays the same.

That's who Boskalis can pay a dividend, without actually paying a dividend.
