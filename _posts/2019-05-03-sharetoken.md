description: How to legally structure share tokens under Swiss law.
---
I am extremely honored to be listed as a co-author of the legal article <a href="/assets/2019-04-05-Aktientoken.pdf">Aktien-Token (share tokens)</a> along with H.C. von der Crone and Martin Monsch. The article was published in the latest issue of <a href="https://www.geskr.ch/zeitschrift/GesKR-Shop-Previous-Issues/geskr-01-2019-de.html">GesKR</a>, the most renowned Swiss journal for corporate and capital market law and professor von der Crone is well-known for his authorship of <a href="https://www.staempfliverlag.com/detail/ISBN-9783727288920>Wertpapierrecht (securities law)"</a>, the reference publication for Swiss securities law.

In the article, we describe a legal path to tokenize equity under the current Swiss law. There is a <a href="https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-74420.html">pending proposal</a> to provide additional legal certainty, but it might take a while until this proposal passes through parliament (if it does). In the meantime, it is important to have a way to tokenize equity under the current laws, which is what the article describes.

The main challenge under current law is transferrability. Generally, certified shares that are printed on paper can be transferred by handing over the paper and uncertified shares that only exist virtually as a claim towards the company that are usually transferred by means of a cession. A cession is a declaration by the old owner to assign a claim to a new owner. And since in Switzerland, cessions must be done in writing, the transfer of shares through a cession also requires the written form. Von der Crone, Kessler and Angstmann already <a href="https://www.ius.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:389cbd0f-b034-43dd-882c-e8447056ab52/von%20der%20Crone,%20Kessler,%20Angstmann,%20Token%20in%20der%20Blockchain,%20SJZ%20114%20(201....pdf">solved this problem last summer</a> by pointing out that - given the consent of all involved parties - claims can also be transferred without formal requirements.

Based on that earlier article, our contribution now describes in more detail how this creative work-around for legal transferrability of claims can be applied to registered shares, for example looking at how the articles of association need to be structured and who has what responsibilities in the tokenization process. One company that already issued their share in the described way is <a href="https://alethena.com">Alethena</a>, which offers the tokenization of equity as a service.
