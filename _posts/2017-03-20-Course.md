I got the opportunity to teach a course in agent-based financial economics and this blog post serves as a preliminary landing page for interested students. If you want to be kept up to date, please provide your e-mail  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiGhMu3cJki9tMcvfgLiaMuUF3KfXLavxgQEIYgUksNL4g4g/viewform>here</a>.

Course description: This is a joint course for UZH and ETH students on agent-based financial economics, a controversial but also promising modeling methodology that thrives best when combining economics knowledge with sound software engineering.
The course starts with an introduction to the principles of agent-based modeling, including its strength and weaknesses. Then, step by step, we will create a large- scale economic simulation by introducing new and increasingly sophisticated agents (households, firms, banks, funds, etc), comparing the simulated outcomes with the equilibria known from classic economic theory. These agents will be implemented by interdisciplinary teams of UZH and ETH students. The fitness of these economic agents will be tested in a competitive setting. Due to the complexity of the simulation, agents will likely have to resort to behavioral heuristics. The interesting question is: Will the invisible hand succeed in guiding them towards the rational expectations outcome anyway?
