title: Tax Wealth and not Capital Gains
description: A paper that confirms my hunch that it is better to tax wealth than capital gains.

In Switzerland, the capital gains of private citizens are not taxed. Instead, there is a moderate wealth tax. I always suspected that this is the preferrable system in comparison to that of other countries that do the opposite. The main reason is a systemic one: with a capital gains tax, those who use their capital most productively, most notably successful entrepreneurs, pay the highest taxes. With a wealth tax, much more tax revenue comes from lazy rich who sit on idle capital without knowing what to do with. The result is a situation in which capital is better allocated and the economy grows faster. Maybe that is one of Switzerland's success secrets?

This view has now been confirmed by [Guvenen et al.](http://papers.nber.org/conf_papers/f102820/f102820.pdf) in an extensive model. John Cochrane also quickly [discusses it on his blog](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.ch/2018/02/a-great-efg.html).
