title: My CEF 2015 paper is available on paper
description: After three years, my paper has finally been published
---
After having been published "online first" last summer, my 2015 paper <a href="http://meissereconomics.com/2016/08/09/StolperSamuelson.html">An agent based simulation of the Stolper-Samuelson effect"</a> has finally been <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-016-9616-x">formally published by Springer</a>, on paper. This was somewhat faster than <a href="http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.ch/2017/09/a-paper-and-publishing.html">what John Cochrane experienced</a> recently, but unlike him, I did not send my paper to a top tier journal. Nonetheless, this illustrates Cochrane's point that journals should be seen as an archive of scientific research, and not the place to look for the latest ideas.
