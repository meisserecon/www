<a href="../../../assets/images/startsummit.jpg"><img src="../../../assets/images/startsummit-small.jpg" alt="Panel" class="image left"></a>Every now and then, I get invited to speak at a conference. This year's highlight so far was the <a href="https://startsummit.ch/">Start Summit</a> in St.Gallen, where I had a nice panel discussion with Daniel Gasteiger from valid <a href="https://valid.global/">Valid</a> and Mona El Isa from <a href="http://melonport.com">Melonport</a>, both blockchain startups. These are interesting times with a lot going on. Will Switzerland keep its competitive edge in the crypto space?
