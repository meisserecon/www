title: How to Pay a Dividend without Paying a Dividend
---
<p><img src="/assets/images/boskalis.jpg" alt="" class="image left"></p><a href="http://boskalis.com">Koninklijke Boskalis Westminster</a> lets its shareholders choose whether they want to receive their yearly
dividend in cash or in the form of newly created shares, creating a paradox in which everyone gets less by choosing more.

When opting for cash, the Dutch government takes a tax of 15%.
If you opt for the shares, you get the equivalent amount in shares tax-free.
This creates an interesting situation: it makes sense for each individual shareholder to opt for the shares, thereby saving the taxes
and getting strictly more value than when opting for cash. However, if every shareholder does so, Boskalis does not need to distribute
a single cent. Instead, it can just issue a few new shares to its shareholders, which makes the whole operation
a de facto stock split instead of a dividend payment. Nothing of value leaves the company and the intrinsic value of the company stays the same.

That's how Boskalis can pay a dividend, without actually paying a dividend.
