title: Applied Game Theory or How to Pay a Dividend without Paying a Dividend
---
<p><img src="/assets/images/boskalis.jpg" alt="" class="image left"></p><a href="http://boskalis.com">Koninklijke Boskalis Westminster</a> lets its shareholders choose whether they want to receive their yearly
dividend in cash or in the form of newly created shares, creating a paradox in which everyone gets less by choosing more.

When opting for cash, the Dutch government takes a tax of 15%.
If you opt for the shares, you get the equivalent amount in shares tax-free.
This creates an interesting situation: it makes sense for each individual shareholder to opt for the shares, thereby saving the taxes
and getting strictly more value than when opting for cash. However, if every shareholder does so, Boskalis does not need to distribute
a single cent. Instead, it can just issue a few new shares to its shareholders, which makes the whole operation
a de facto stock split instead of a dividend payment. Nothing of value leaves the company and the intrinsic value of the company stays the same.

That's how Boskalis can pay a dividend, without actually paying a dividend.

**Theoretical foundations**
This post has sparked a lively discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11821150">hackernews</a>, with some commentors doubting that there is much game theory at work here. This section describes the theoretical foundations of the above, showing that this is indeed a prisoner's dilemma style game under the right assumptions.

Let's assume a share price of 100 and a dividend of 5%, so the price will drop 5% on dividend day, otherwise, there would be an arbitrage opportunity. So after dividend day, a share will trade at 95. Let's further assume that buying and selling large quantities of shares has an impact of price. This is the most bold assumption here, as it violates the efficient market hypothesis. Feel free to disagree here, but not with my other arguments. In particular, I assume that selling 5% of the outstanding shares will push the price down from p to p*s. So if the price goes down 3%, p is 0.97. Similarly, t=0.85 reflects taxes on dividends of 15%. (There is no capital gains tax in this example.)

This leads to the following prisoner's dilemma situation, illustrated as a game theoretic decision table:

|     |        | **everyone else**  |   |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|---|
|     |        | cash     | shares |   |
| | cash   | 95+5t    | 95s+5t |   |
| **you**  |        |      |  |   |
|  | shares&nbsp;&nbsp; | 95+5     | 95s+5  |   |

For p=0.99 or lower, you are always better off by choosing shares and selling the received shares. However, if everyone does, everyone gets less.
