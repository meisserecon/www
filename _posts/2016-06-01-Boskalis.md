title: Applied Game Theory or How to Pay a Dividend without Paying a Dividend
---
<p><img src="/assets/images/boskalis.jpg" alt="" class="image left"></p><a href="http://boskalis.com">Koninklijke Boskalis Westminster</a> lets its shareholders choose whether they want to receive their yearly
dividend in cash or in the form of newly created shares, creating a paradox in which everyone gets less by choosing more.

When opting for cash, the Dutch government takes a tax of 15%.
If you opt for the shares, you get the equivalent amount in shares tax-free.
This creates an interesting situation: it makes sense for each individual shareholder to opt for the shares, thereby saving the taxes
and getting strictly more value than when opting for cash. However, if every shareholder does so, Boskalis does not need to distribute
a single cent. Instead, it can just issue a few new shares to its shareholders, which makes the whole operation
a de facto stock split instead of a dividend payment. Nothing of value leaves the company and the intrinsic value of the company stays the same.

That's how Boskalis can pay a dividend, without actually paying a dividend.

Note: this post has sparked a discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11821150">hackernews</a>, with some commentors doubting that there is much game theory at work here. The Litmus test for that is to check whether the decision of an individual shareholder affects the others. I argue that this is indeed the case if the shareholders have a preference for cash. If there is only one shareholder, he would clearly opt for the cash dividend, knowing that selling the equivalent amount of shares would adversely affect the market price. However, minority shareholders would probably opt for the shares, thinking that they could sell the shares without affecting the market much, thereby ending up with 15% more cash in the end. And there is the negative externality: by opting for the shares and selling them, you push down the price a little for everyone, even though it only marginally affects you. So collectively, the shareholders will decide differently than if they were the only shareholder and might end up with less than if they would have chosen the cash dividend. Note that this argument only works when assuming that markets are not perfectly efficient, i.e. assuming that selling large quantities of shares affects their price by enough to offset the tax savings.
