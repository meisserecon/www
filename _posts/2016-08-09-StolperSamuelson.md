<p><img src="/assets/images/loop.jpg" alt="" class="image left"></p>The paper "<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2794828">An Agent-Based Simulation of the Stolper-Samuelson effect"</a> just got accepted for publication in <a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/10614">Computational Economics</a>. Originally, this was a term paper Friedrich Kreuser and I wrote for the course Computational Economics and Finance in spring 2014, and that I presented at <a href="http://www.aiecon.org/conference/cef2015/">CEF 2015</a>.

<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2794828">The paper</a> is about replicating a well-known phenomenon from classic economic theory, namely the Stolper-Samuelson effect, in an agent-based simulation. We succeeded at doing so with high accuracy thanks to the adoption of a few new algorithmic ideas. Interestingly, the agent-based simulation is much faster at finding the correct result than Mathematica or Matlab can solve the corresponding equation system from the classic theory.
