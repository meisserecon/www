<p><img src="/assets/images/bordeaux.jpg" alt="" class="image left"></p>I presented my paper <a href="/assets/images/heuristics.pdf">Seemingly Equivalent Firm Decision Heuristics</a> (<a href="https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?paper_id=87&file_type=slides">the slide deck</a>) at the <a href="https://editorialexpress.com/conference/CEF2016/program/CEF2016.html#61">Computating in Economics and Finance Conference (CEF 2016)</a>, with a few very well-known computational economists in the audience, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Bouchaud">Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</a>, <a href="http://www.wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de/lehrbereiche/vwl/etace/team/hdawid/">Herbert Dawid</a>, and <a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~blebaron/">Blake LeBaron</a>. Overall, the paper was well-received despite its limited scope (or maybe exactly because of it :) ).

The paper is about an often overlooked detail in agent-based economics models, namely how firms should calculate their dividends. To summarise, dividends should be larger than profits when a firm is larger than optimal, and smaller than profits if the firm wants to grow. This sounds like common sense, but many existing models unfortunately do not adhere to this (one commenter argued that this might actually be more realistic, even if not optimal). Also, there are a few subtle details - for example the question of how exactly to measure revenue - that can make the model more or less stable. In extreme cases, the simulation breaks down in economic chaos even though the chosen dividend heuristic is correct in equilibrium. Overall, agent-based modelling seems to gain traction, but is still far away from realising its potential.
