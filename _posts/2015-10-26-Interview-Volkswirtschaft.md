title: Interview in <em>Die Volkswirtschaft</em>

<p><emp>Die Volkswirtschaft</em>, a Swiss economics journal, interviewed me on the relation between state and startups. The interview titled <em>The State Shouldn't Stay in the Way</em> was published <a href="http://dievolkswirtschaft.ch/de/2015/10/meisser-11-2015/">in German</a> as well as <a href="http://dievolkswirtschaft.ch/fr/2015/10/letat-ne-doit-pas-se-mettre-en-travers-du-chemin/">in French</a> on 2015-10-26.</p>

<p>Luzius emphasizes the importance of a low level of bureacracy for startups to flourish. Generally, the fixed costs caused by regulation pose a disproportionate burden on startups in comparison to larger companies. It is argued that the state should not invest in startups, neither directly nor indirectly through pension funds. For startups, having smart money from investors that care and can help is essential. Taxing these investors, and then letting a hired expert without skin in the game decide where to invest the collected taxes again turns smart money into dumb money, thereby destroying value.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to help with funding, as it is sometimes discussed, the state should rather focus on its core responsibility, namely effectively providing a reliable infrastructure.</p>
