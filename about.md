<p>Meisser Economics AG is a Swiss corporation domiziled in the Canton of Zurich. It was founded in 2016 with the purposes of research, education and consulting at the intersection of economics and computer science. At the moment, Luzius Meisser is its sole employee.

<p><img src="/assets/images/luzius.jpg" alt="" class="image left"> I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, have previously founded a cloud storage startup, and currently preside the <a href="http://bitcoinassociation.ch/">Bitcoin Association Switzerland</a>. Furthermore, I am about to complete a master's in Economics at University of Zurich, where I plans to start a PhD in September.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation Trilogy</a> inspired me with the vision of building large scale economic simulations early on in my life. This long-term project aims at pursuing this vision. I strongly believe that coming from computer science, there are many low-hanging fruits to be picked in economics -- similar to the progress that has been made by mathematicians and physicist entering the field earlier. In particular, methods and tools from modern software engineering are well-suited to manage the organizational and technical complexity of building large-scale models.</p>
