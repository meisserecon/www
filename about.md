<p>Meisser Economics AG is a Swiss corporation domiziled in the Canton of Zurich. It was founded in 2016 with the purposes of research, education and consulting at the intersection of economics and computer science. At the moment, Luzius Meisser is its sole employee. You can get in touch by writing to <em>luzius@meissereconomics.com</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/luzius2.jpg" alt="" class="image left"> I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich and a master's degree in Economics from University of Zurich. I have previously founded a cloud storage startup, and have invested in a few select Swiss startups. I am board member of <a href="http://bitcoinsuisse.ch">Bitcoin Suisse</a>, <a href="http://quitt.ch">quitt.ch</a>, as well as <a href="http://bitcoinassociation.ch/">Bitcoin Association Switzerland</a>, . Furthermore, I am <a href="http://www.phd-finance.uzh.ch/en/People/students/meisser.html">a PhD student</a> at the <a href="http://www.bf.uzh.ch/">Institute for Banking and Finance</a>, University of Zurich.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation Trilogy</a> inspired me with the vision of building large scale economic simulations early on in my life. This long-term project aims at pursuing this vision. I strongly believe that coming from computer science, there are many low-hanging fruits to be picked in economics -- similar to the progress that has been made by mathematicians and physicists entering the field earlier. In particular, methods and tools from modern software engineering are well-suited to manage the organizational and technical complexity of building large-scale models.</p>
