<p>Meisser Economics AG is a Swiss corporation domiziled in the Canton of Zurich. It was founded in 2016 with the purposes of research, education and consulting at the intersection of economics and computer science. At the moment, Luzius Meisser is its sole employee. You can get in touch by writing to luzius@meissereconomics.com .</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/luzius.jpg" alt="" class="image left"> Luzius holds a Master's degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. He has successfully co-founded a secure cloud storage startup, and currently presides the <a href="http://bitcoinassociation.ch/">Bitcoin Association Switzerland</a>. Furthermore, he is about to complete a master's in Economics at University of Zurich, where he plans to start a PhD in September.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation Trilogy</a> infected me with the vision of building large scale economic simulations early on in my life. This long-term project aims at pursuing this vision. I strongly believe that coming from computer science, there are many low-hanging fruits to be plucked in economics -- similar to the progress that has been made by mathematicians and physicist entering the field earlier.</p>
